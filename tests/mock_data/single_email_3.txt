{'from': 'Jill Leslie <jileslie@westmont.edu>', 'from-email': 'jileslie@westmont.edu', 'subject': 'Beach Courts', 'body': 'Good morning, I just wanted to let everyone know that the beach courts we reserved for class were washed away by the rain. There is no class this Thursday (2/26) since I am out of town, but you can still go to East Beach and play if you are interested. However, you will just have to find another court to play on; usually, courts are open during class time. When we have class again in two weeks, I will get to the courts early, reserve courts for us, and send you an email with the court location once I know it. One last reminder: since there will be no class on Thursday (2/26), there will be a small assignment on Canvas due on Thursday that will count as your participation for the week. Please let me know if you have any questions. Have a great week. Best, Jill Leslie', 'rfc-id': '<CACvAnHMj+qbr=CCT6DDtBw9obBmnsUNcLLOWZDd+pHWoaJ4F0g@mail.gmail.com>'}
